1: API
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of defined rules that enables different applications to communicate with each other. It allows developers to access specific functionality or data from another application or service.

2: SDK
A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers can use to build applications for a specific platform, software, or hardware.

3: Web APIs
Web APIs are APIs that are accessed through the web, using protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS, and are used to interact with web applications, services, or data.

4: Library APIs
Library APIs are APIs that provide access to a collection of pre-built functionality, such as code libraries or frameworks, that can be used by developers to build applications.

5: Prompting and Completion
Prompting and completion refer to the process of providing input (prompting) to an AI model and receiving a generated response (completion) that completes or responds to the input prompt.
