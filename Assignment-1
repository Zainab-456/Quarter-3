1. Messages:
    - Definition: Input prompts or texts given to the model to generate a response.
    - Example: A user types "Tell me a joke" into a chatbot, and the chatbot responds with a joke. In this case, "Tell me a joke" is the message.

2. Model:
    - Definition: A trained algorithm that can perform a specific task, such as generating text.
    - Example: A language translation model is trained on a large dataset of text in multiple languages and can translate text from one language to another. When a user inputs "Bonjour, comment ça va?" (French), the model outputs "Hello, how are you?" (English).

3. Max Completion Tokens:
    - Definition: The maximum number of tokens (words, characters, or subwords) that the model is allowed to generate in response to a given input.
    - Example: A user asks a chatbot to write a short story, and the model is set to generate a maximum of 200 tokens. The chatbot responds with a story that is approximately 200 words long.

4. n:
    - Definition: The number of generated responses or samples that the model should produce for a given input.
    - Example: A user asks a language model to generate three different responses to the prompt "What is the meaning of life?", and the model outputs three distinct responses:
        - Response 1: "The meaning of life is to find happiness and fulfillment."
        - Response 2: "The meaning of life is to pursue knowledge and understanding."
        - Response 3: "The meaning of life is to connect with others and build meaningful relationships."

5. Stream:
    - Definition: A continuous flow of input data that the model processes in real-time.
    - Example: A live chatbot is integrated into a customer support website, and it processes incoming customer queries in real-time, responding to each query as it is received.

6. Temperature:
    - Definition: A parameter that controls the randomness or creativity of the generated text.
    - Example: A user asks a language model to generate a poem, and the model is set to a high temperature value (e.g., 1.2). The resulting poem is creative and unexpected, with unusual word choices and metaphors. If the temperature value were set lower (e.g., 0.5), the poem would be more predictable and conservative.

7. Top_p:
    - Definition: A parameter that controls the proportion of the most likely next tokens that the model considers when generating text.
    - Example: A user asks a language model to generate a sentence, and the model is set to a low top_p value (e.g., 0.1). The resulting sentence is more diverse and unexpected, with less common word choices. If the top_p value were set higher (e.g., 0.9), the sentence would be more predictable and conservative.

8. Tools:
    - Definition: Software or interfaces that allow users to interact with the model, provide input, and receive generated output.
    - Example: A user interacts with a chatbot interface to ask questions and receive responses. The chatbot interface is a tool that allows the user to access the underlying language model and receive generated text.
